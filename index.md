Welcome to the second edition of the Bordeaux Neurocampus Open Science Workshop, a 3-day workshop dedicated to promoting Open Science principles. 

This edition will take place from May 26th to May 28th, 2025.

## Venue

[Bordeaux Neurocampus](https://www.bordeaux-neurocampus.fr/en/){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"}

## Important dates

- **Call for application:** April - May  2025
- **Notification of acceptance:** Before Mid May 2025
- **Workshop:** May 26th- 28th 2023

## Application

Applications are now open!

PhD students at the University of Bordeaux should register on ADUM in order to validate doctoral school training hours.

Otherwise, please complete the following form [here](https://forms.gle/t6dXv9gToHSNGEX27){:target="_blank"}{:rel="noopener noreferrer"} if you want to attend our workshop. 

We are looking forward to hearing from you!


## Our engagements 

**Free registration**: we believe in making Open Science accessible to all. That is why registration, practical workshops, and coffee breaks are completely free of charge.

*The lectures are open to everyone. However, only 30 places are available to attend the workshops.*

**Comprehensive program**: Our workshop is designed to cater to both theoretical and practical needs. The program includes engaging theoretical sessions where you will gain a deep understanding of the principles and components of Open Science. Additionally, hands-on practical workshops will equip you with the skills and tools needed to implement Open Science practices seamlessly in your research.

**Targeted audience**: This workshop is specifically tailored for PhD students, Post Docs, and Early Career Researchers in Life Sciences. We understand the challenges one can face in the early stages of a career, and our workshop aims to provide you with the knowledge and resources to excel in the evolving research landscape.

**Collaborative environment**: The Open Science Workshop at Bordeaux Neurocampus is not just about learning; it's also about building connections and fostering collaboration. Engage in group discussions, share your experiences, and connect with like-minded researchers from diverse disciplines. This workshop provides a unique opportunity to expand your network and form valuable connections for future collaborations.

## Content details

**Pre-registration in Neuroscience: What, Why, and How**
Pre-registration is gaining traction across many scientific fields as a way to increase transparency, reduce analytic flexibility, and minimize bias in interpreting and reporting results. But why exactly should you pre-register your study and is it practical for neuroscience research? The talk will introduce the core ideas behind preregistration and the benefits it offers. We will look at the scientific problems it aims to address – such as p-hacking, HARKing, and flexibility in data analysis – and how preregistration helps tackle them. Examples from psychology, neuroscience, and biomedical research will be used to explore the relevance of pre-registration, and understand its structure and key elements. We will also look at resources and platforms which help researchers integrate preregistration into their workflow.

**Peer review in major biomedical journals**
This workshop is a spin-off of the semester-long “Peerspectives” training program at the Charité and is specifically tailored for early-career researchers and doctoral students with little or no prior publishing or peer review experience. Emphasizing the importance of thoughtful review of methods, you will be guided through an interactive lecture and group exercises in the workshop segment that will get you thinking like a peer reviewer and editor. You will not only learn how to give more effective feedback but also how to improve your own writing. We’ll take a critical look at the scientific publishing system and talk about modern developments in peer review such as open review and post-publication review.

**Big-Team Science and Open Science: Opportunities, Challenges, and the Future of Inclusive Collaboration**
Big-team science (BTS) initiatives have transformed research by fostering large-scale collaboration, transparency, and data sharing. However, while BTS offers exciting opportunities for advancing Open Science, it also introduces new challenges — particularly regarding diversity, equity, accessibility, and inclusion (DEAI); credit and authorship practices; and systemic incentives in academia. In this talk, I will reflect on how BTS projects can promote or undermine Open Science ideals, using real-world examples. The session will be conversational in style, with time for open discussion and Q&A with attendees, to collectively explore how to maximize the societal and scholarly impact of big-team collaborations.

**Scaling Open Science Education: Leveraging FORRT Resources for Training, Research, and Community Engagement**
The Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) is a global initiative bridging metascience, pedagogy, and policy to advance open and reproducible research practices. Despite the growing adoption of Open Science, barriers persist in integrating transparency, replication, and rigor into education and research training. In this workshop, we will introduce participants to FORRT’s educational resources, including structured training materials, replication research support, and open-access pedagogical tools. Attendees will learn how to leverage FORRT’s resources in their own teaching, research, or mentoring. We will also highlight opportunities for participants to engage with ongoing FORRT projects and discuss our structured credit allocation process for contributors. Together, we will explore how to build more inclusive, transparent, and impactful scientific practices from the ground up.

**Introducing FORRT Curriculum**
The next generation of researchers and consumers of science must be equipped with knowledge of open and reproducible research to maintain and further scientific standards. Thus, educators and mentors must be able to provide a strong foundation in Open Research training. The Framework for Open and Reproducible Research Training (FORRT) is working on different initiatives to facilitate the uptake of Open Research teaching. In this presentation, I will discuss some of these initiatives. I will first discuss FORRT's Pedagogies, where we interview educators who are implementing Open Research tenets in their education in exemplary ways. I will then present POSTEdu, a self-guided program developed in consultation with the academic community for educators interested in teaching Open Research through positive, participatory, and inclusive lenses. Finally, I will present FORRT's current efforts in developing educational materials for different topics of Open Research. Researchers at different stages of their careers are welcome to participate in this initiative either as content creators or reviewers.

**Making the Implicit Explicit: Co-Developing a guide to help early-careers navigate the hidden curriculum in academia**
The hidden curriculum refers to unwritten rules and norms in academia which are not explicitly taught to students and early-career academics. Such implicit rules and norms are counterproductive to several academics who are trying to navigate academia and plan their careers in successful ways, but they can be detrimental to many early-career scholars who come from less privileged backgrounds and have less cultural and economic capital to enter, enjoy and stay in academia. Unveiling the hidden curriculum can ultimately contribute to the development of academic spaces that are more diverse, inclusive and equitable. In this workshop, we will discuss some initial ideas about whether a guide with questions and answers would be helpful. We will also discuss and hopefully co-create an initial format for such a guide. Contributions will be properly acknowledged.
